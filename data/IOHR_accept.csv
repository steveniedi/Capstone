My first dog, Marie was adopted via Eve's Sanctuary Animal Rescue in 2009.  Though already a senior, she lived until 2017.  I loved her and still do immensely.  She succumbed to natural causes (a series of strokes, my vet believes + liver disease/failure) and we had her put to sleep in October 2017.  I adopted another chihuahua in July 2018 from Beastly Pet Rescue here in NYC.  He lived only a few months.  He was a senior too and had some eye issues, but lived really happily for a few months until early Dec and he failed very quickly one evening.  We took him to Blue Pearl emergency in Hells Kitchen and they concluded that he was in congestive heart failure and would not live through the night.  We decided immediately to put him to sleep so he would not suffer.  He was having trouble breathing and was panicked.  It was very hard but I know we gave him a beautiful ending to a rather unsatisfying life.  He had a warm bed (mine lol), good food and a lot of attention. In addition to cashmere sweaters -ha!  I feel it's a service to adopt dogs, particularly ones that are not puppies.  I am looking for a chihuahua - small - preferably below 5-6 lbs.  as I would like to take the dog with me to work, and while i'm outdoors in NYC.  I did this with my first dog Marie quite often - I took her around in a cross body sling, secured in and close to me.   Age does not matter too much but I very much prefer to adopt a dog that is not a puppy or too old (I just went though that).  Middle aged is great.

After graduating University and with an established career, I was the proud Mother of my two beloved American Eskimos. I was heartbroken when they passed away within one year of each other. And still grieve-stricken to this day when my mind wanders to that place in time. For the past couple of years I have been considering the idea of adopting a rescue dog. Now that my daughter is independent, I have been researching the process. When my sister brought home their Chocolate Labrador, Remy, in 2017, I fell in love. Remy & I have formed an unexpected bond…he follows me throughout their house, plops himself at my feet, or plops his big body on top of me when sitting on the floor. I engrossed myself in Remy’s care, training, feeding, housebreaking, & walking…And then I miss him when I leave my sister’s NJ home. During my last visit in August, there was a pivotal moment during which I was getting ready to leave:  Remy is aware I am packing up. He is following me back & forth as I load my SUV. He tries to gently clutch my arm with his mouth while I pet & kiss him good-bye. He barks as I get into my car. He will not leave the driver’s side door. No treats will persuade him. My sister has to pull Remy away from my SUV. Finally in the house, he pries at the slightly open the door. He leaps out & bounds right back to the driver’s side door. He is just sitting there looking up at me, waiting for me come out. I can barely look at him without breaking into tears. Now the whole family is pulling him away from my car. He is tugging back & craning his neck toward me during the entire struggle. Remy is back in the house, but now at the window. He has jumped up & is barking. He is watching me drive away all while following the whole length of the window. That was the pivotal moment…when I realized I am missing a dog in my life. I am ready to take the next step. I have always been financially ready.

If the dog needs to be housebroken, or presents a danger to himself if he/she is unsupervised, then a crate is used when constant supervision isn't possible.  when housebreaking a dog, I don't believe in giving a dog run of a house, rather I keep them in a smaller room with a gate across the doorway so they can be seen, and they are taken out hourly to relieve themselves.  once they go, I allow them to have playtime in the house for a time, then they will be place back in their room, until I bring them out again.  I have never had any problems housebreaking a dog utilizing this housebreaking method.  They catch on very quickly that when they leave their room or crate, the first thing they do is head outside, then that is followed by playtime, and repeated until they are trained. ","We do not.
