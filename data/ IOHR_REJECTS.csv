The breeder helped me select the pup with the personality and energy level I was looking for and Cooper was perfect. Calm, sweet, friendly and ohh so snuggly. He was my doggy soulmate. We did everything together, training, working, sleeping, grooming, etc... Fast forward a few years and my future husband wants to get Cooper a playmate who can be more ""his dog"" because Cooper obviously preferred me. He used the same breeder, but picked a more ""lively"" pup who ended up being very high energy, pushy and even a bit domineering. Cooper barely tolerated Sammy. We tried for years to make it work, but Cooper was miserable and started showing it by having potty ""accidents"" in the house. Sammy, being a puppy, followed suit. Cooper also started excessively barking and frantically licking himself, and Sammy learned to be an excessive barker as well. We tried numerous trainers and even a two week ""bootcamp"" for Sammy, but nothing helped. Fast forward a few more years and our second human baby in 17 months was born and my lap was occupied by nursing babies 24/7. The dogs only got worse, being pushed to the back burner. The barking and questionable carpet (we were in a rental back then) were big sources of stress with babies trying to sleep all day and learning how to crawl. To say that it was overwhelming, would be an understatement. But the worse part was seeing how miserable the dogs were. They went from being the center of my universe to being pushed to the way back burner. It wasn't fair to them. After months of agonizing discussion, we made the difficult decision to rehome them to SEPARATE, but individually perfect homes to suit their needs. Cooper was adopted by 2 retired mamas who dote on him 24/7. Sammy was adopted by two fun loving dads who make sure that everyday is the adventure Sammy craves. We are still in touch with both families and receive frequent updates. We still talk about ""the buddies"" all the time and miss them like crazy. But we know we did what was best for them at the time. Now, our human kids are 6 and 4.5 and we finally feel we are ready to find our forever family dog. We didn't make any of these decisions lightly, and genuinely feel that we and the kids are ready.
